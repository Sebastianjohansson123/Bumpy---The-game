# Bumpy Monster
We have created a game called "Bumpy Monster." It consists of the character Bumpy - a purple monster who jumps upward in a game level with the help of platforms. The game is an endless game where you collect points as you go higher up the level. It costs 10 points to shoot. On the way up, there are power ups and enemies in the form of other monsters. If you hit an enemy, you get 100 points and if you hit the "Boss," you get 500 points. If Bumpy misses a jump to the next platform or crashes into an enemy, it falls down and the game is over. Bumpy can shoot enemies with bubbles from its head. Bumpy can also move horizontally across the screen. Depending on whether Bumpy gets a power up, it moves either faster upward in the level and becomes invincible, or becomes invincible and kills enemies on collision for a certain time interval. The background in the game changes during the game. If Bumpy dies, "Game Over" is displayed and the score obtained from the current game and the high score are also displayed.
